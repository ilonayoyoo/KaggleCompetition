>This Kaggle Getting Started Competition provides an ideal starting place for people who may not have a lot of experience in data science and machine learning."

From the competition [homepage](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted).

### Goal for this Notebook:
Show a simple example of an analysis of the Titanic disaster in Python using a full complement of PyData utilities. This is aimed for those looking to get into the field or those who are already in the field and looking to see an example of an analysis done with Python.

#### Dataset Description
#### File descriptions

*    analysisData.csv: Data for building a model
*    scoringData.csv: Use for applying predictions or scoring
*    example_submission.csv: Sample submission file in the desired format

#### Description

*    Predict the price of a used car. You are given a dataset on 40,000 used cars. The data describes each car based on its features and its condition.

#### Goal

*    Construct a model to predict sale price of a used car based on its features and condition and use it to generate predictions for a set of unlabeled data.

#### Metric

*    Submissions will be evaluated based on RMSE (root mean squared error) (Wikipedia). Lower the RMSE, better the model.

#### Submission File

*    The submission file should be in text format (.csv) with only two columns, id and rating. The rating column must contain predicted rating. Number of decimal places to use is up to you. The file should contain a header and have the following format:


#### This Notebook will show basic examples of:
#### Data Handling
*   Importing Data with Pandas
*   Cleaning Data
*   Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

#### Data Analysis
*    Supervised Machine learning Techniques:
    +   Logit Regression Model
    +   Plotting results
    +   Support Vector Machine (SVM) using 3 kernels
    +   Basic Random Forest
    +   Plotting results

#### Valuation of the Analysis
*   K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
*   Output the results from the IPython Notebook to Kaggle
